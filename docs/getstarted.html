	<h2>How to get started</h2>
        <p>
          This page should help you with getting AssaultCube installed and making it work. If you've ever played
          <a href="http://cubeengine.com/cube.php4">CUBE</a> or <a href="http://sauerbraten.org/">Sauerbraten</a> 
          and either of them runs fine, then so should AssaultCube.

          System requirements
        </h4>
        <p id="minspecs">
          The following are the bare minimum requirements. AssaultCube may require you to use very low graphics settings
          to play on a system like this. As you would expect, the more powerful than this, the better!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Processor: Intel Pentium III or AMD K7 range.</li>
          <li>GFX: NVIDIA GeForce 256 or ATi Radeon R7000.</li>
          <li>RAM: 192 MB.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It will also require one of the following, capable operating systems:

              You'll need to make sure the appropriate OpenGL drivers are installed, plus these libraries

              If you can run the neccesary libraries/drivers and are able to compile the AssaultCube source
              code by yourself, then you may be able to port AssaultCube onto other platforms.
              However, please note that we may be unable to support these platforms.

          Enhancing performance for low-end machines
        </h4>
        <p>
          As previously stated, the hardware specifications shown above are the bare minimums, so you may require a 
          bit of adjustment to get AssaultCube to run on a system like that. Of course, we recommend that you run AssaultCube
          on better hardware than this. Here's a few things to do to help AssaultCube can run well on such low specifications.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Firstly, ensure you have <a href="graphicsdrivers.html">updated your graphics drivers</a>!</li>
          <li>Secondly, if you're using a laptop, plug in the power, then check if any power-saving features are hindering AssaultCube.</li>
          <li>In your operating system, set your resolution to 800x600 and colour depth to 16-bit (high colour).</li>
          <li>
            In your graphics driver software, turn off or turn down as many "extra" options that your graphics card allows, 
            such as anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn on "vsync" in your graphics driver software (however, turn this off again, if you find AssaultCube performs poorly).
          </li>
          <li>
            In AssaultCube, set the resolution to be exactly the same as your operating systems resolution.<br>
            This can be done in the &#8220;Settings&#8221; -&rsaquo; &#8220;Video Settings&#8221; menu; under the "Screen width" and "Screen height" options.
          </li>
          <li>
            To make things easy, we've put most of AssaultCubes graphic options in one easy slider. In AssaultCube, you can go to the
            &#8220;Settings&#8221; -&rsaquo; &#8220;Video Settings&#8221; menu &amp; slide the "Graphics detail" option to the lowest option.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These links should be able to help further if you would like to know more about tweaking your graphics card settings:

              download the tarball labelled "source" from Sourceforge as well as the linux tarball package.

          Files that AssaultCube writes during the game (such as screenshots, settings and maps) get saved
          into a seperate folder known as the "AssaultCube home folder". The location of this folder differs,
          depending on your operating system.<br>

	Server process
	</h2>
                <p>
                    The dedicated server runs in the shell only (no graphics), with increased priority.
                    However, it uses very little CPU time and memory, so you can run one in the background,
                    or at the same time as the client if you want to host a game and play in it. The default
                    server ports are UDP <b>28763</b> (game) and <b>28764</b> (info). If you choose to set
                    your own port as X (with the <span class="code">-f</span> option) it will automatically
                    use X+1 for the info port! See the <a href="getstarted.html" shape="rect">Get Started Guide</a>
                    to find out how to join a server.
                </p>
                <h2 id="configuration">
                    Main Configuration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The easiest way to configure the AssaultCube server is through the options in
                    <i>config/servercmdline.txt</i>.
                    The server scripts, <i>assaultcube_server.bat</i> on windows or
                    <i>assaultcube_server.sh</i> on linux, use this method by default. All the possible command
                    line options are documented in this file, and you simply have to uncomment (remove the //'s
                    from the start of the line) and edit the ones you want to use.
                </p>
                <p>
	     You can still assign the options on the command line if you have an existing server, or 
	     you prefer this method. The command line options can also be obtained from the <a href=
                    "commandline.html" shape="rect">command line section</a> of this documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you've configured your server, run the script to start it. You should see the message:
                    <pre xml:space="preserve">
		looking up assault.cubers.net...
		master server registration succeeded
	     </pre>
	     If you don't see this, use the <a href="http://assault.cubers.net/search.html">website search facility</a>
	     to search for the output you do see. The most common reason for failure is incorrectly
	     <a href="http://wiki.cubers.net/action/view/Port_forwarding">forwarded ports</a>.

                LAN/private server
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A server automatically acts as a LAN server, and any clients on the same subnet will be able to
                    connect through the <b>Join to a LAN server</b> menu option. If you want the server to remain
                    private, and not be displayed on the public in-game server list, you must use the <span class="code">-m</span>
                    option to change the master server. It's common to use <span class="code">-mlocalhost</span>
                    to achieve this, but any other hostname or IP address will do.
	 </p>
                <h2 id="numberofclients">
                    Number of clients
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deciding on the maximum number of clients (<span class="code">-c</span> option) that can connect
                    to your server can be a difficult task.
                    The maximum you can have, and still register with the Master Server, is 16, but the maximum
                    that your server can <b>efficiently support</b> is dictated by the <b>upstream</b> bandwidth
                    of your internet connection. If you overload your connection with too many clients, they will
                    all suffer from lag spikes, regardless of geographical distance from the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The server list gives an indication of a server's error rate; green is good, red is bad. Error rate
                    can be affected by line quality and/or limited bandwidth. Pressing <b>F9</b>, followed by <b>F2</b>
                    brings up a further graphic showing how the error rate is affected by client connections.

                    Whenever a player connects to a server (or changes his nickname), the nickname is compared to the
                    whitelist and the blacklist. First, the nickname (as a whole) is searched in the whitelist. If the
                    nickname is in the whitelist, the player's IP and password are checked (if required). If an IP range
                    or password requirement is not met, the player gets kicked. If the nickname is not in the whitelist,
                    it is checked against the blacklist. If a blacklist entry matches, the player gets kicked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To prevent whitelist entries being misused by other players, each entry can be secured by one or more
                    IP ranges and one or more passwords. IP ranges are very convenient to use. For players with static IP,
                    this is a very secure method to prevent others from using the nickname. If the IP is dynamic, it
                    depends on how big the used IP range is. A single /16 range should be secure enough for most cases.
                    If the range is bigger, the IP range will not block others sufficiently. In those cases, passwords can
                    be used.

                        the connect password has to match one of them.

                    If there are things you just don't want people to say in your server, this file, specified
                    with the <span class="code">-g</span> option (default: <i>config/forbidden.cfg</i>),
                    contains example words and phrases which will be barred from public display. If a
                    client types one of these words or phrases, it will be displayed on their HUD only, along

                    In the server password file specified with the <span class="code">-X</span> option (default:
                    <i>config/serverpwd.cfg</i>), you can specify admin passwords and passwords
                    to bypass server bans. Each line defines one password.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example:
                </p>
                <pre xml:space="preserve">
		// list of additional server admin passwords
		// WARNING: You can NOT use CubeScript in here!!
		// one password per line

		// Use the following scheme...
		// password [denyadmin]
		// optional: if denyadmin is set to '1' then
		// the password can only be used to connect to the server in case of ban, not to claim admin

		Lorem 1
		ipsum
		dolor 0
	 </pre>
                <p>
                    In the above example three passwords are defined: <i>Lorem</i>, <i>ipsum</i> and <i>dolor</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>ipsum</i> and <i>dolor</i> are full admin passwords. They can be used to claim admin, connect
                    to a full server and to get over a server ban.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Lorem</i> is a less powerful password: it can only be used to connect to a server that has a pending
                    ban on the user. This kind of password is useful, whenever a blacklist range ban affects innocent players.

                    Cheating is a problem that can't be solved entirely. AssaultCube is open source,
                    so everyone who knows how to compile it can easily modify the source to do
                    whatever he wants; that's the problem of open source games. The fact that most of
                    the game logic is client-side, to save bandwidth, makes it even easier
                    to cheat. There is no way to completely avoid this abuse, but cheats should be kicked
                    from the game as soon as possible, to ensure fair play for everyone else.

                    Server Admin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a client role a player can claim called <i>admin</i>. It can be
                    claimed by the owner of a server (or players the owner trusts) to take control
                    over what is happening when they are present. Claiming admin state requires a
                    password that matches the server configuration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main advantage of the admin role is its overriding vote power. A 'yes' (F1)
                    or 'no' (F2) vote from an admin will be the deciding vote immediately. Read more about
                    being an admin of a server on the <a href="http://wiki.cubers.net/action/view/Admin">AssaultCube wiki</a>.

                    because you are banned, master mode is private or because all client slots are
                    taken, you can use the <span class="code">connectadmin</span> command to get
                    control back. If you want to leave the server in the hands of a certain
                    player <span class="code">giveadmin</span> can be used to give control to a
                    honest player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The admin password is best configured using the

                    be set with <a href="commandline.html#server-x" shape="rect">-x</a> on the command line.
                </p>
                <h2 id="serverlogs">
                    Server logs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By default, a running server will log to a file in the main AssaultCube folder (Windows),
                    or the </i>gamedata</i> folder (Mac) or to the syslog (linux). The level of detail in the
                    log can be controlled with the <span class="code">-LF</span> or <span class="code">-LS</span>
                    options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The log can be used as reference for IP addresses of connected clients, a record of
                    things said during a game or an indication of suspicious client activity (using the game's
                    anticheat coding), and contains many other pieces of information.
	 </p>
                <h2 id="killmessages">
                    Kill Messages
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can control how kills are reported in your log with the kill messages file, specified
                    with the <span class="code">-E</span> option (default: <i>config/serverkillmessages.cfg</i>).
                    These messages will appear in your log only; you can't control what messages the clients see.
                </p>
	 <h2 id="serverdemos">
	     Demos
	 </h2>
	 <p>
	     By default, a server will store records of the previous 5 games in RAM, as downloadable demos.
	     It's possible to change the number of stored demos with the <span class="code">-D</span> option,
	     and you can also write the demos to disk, and change the location and file prefix, using the
	     <span class="code">-W</span> option.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	     As a responsible server owner, you may be approached by players who were on your server, requesting
	     a demo they may have forgotten to get in-game, or a piece of information from the log. Releasing these
	     is, of course, at your discretion.

	 <h1>
	     Important: Server modifications
	 </h1>
	 <p>
	     <b>Obviously AssaultCube is an open source game, and the server code is open to modification. You may
	     find that some part of the server code can be improved (please let us know if this is the case), or
	     that it doesn't provide a bit of functionality that you require. You're welcome to compile your own
	     server binary, provided that any changes you make don't affect the gameplay. We want to ensure that
	     all clients connecting to public servers are aware of the game modes, ammo and health settings, game
	     physics, etc., and that there are no surprises. If your server is deemed to have a gameplay-affecting
	     modification, it will be removed from the master server list.</b>

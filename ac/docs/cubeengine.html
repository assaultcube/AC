<h1>How the AssaultCube/Cube Engine works</h1>
<p>
      AssaultCube is based on the FPS <a href="http://cubeengine.com/" shape="rect">Cube</a> and so (apart from all the changes and also the 
      backports from Cube2/Sauerbraten) it works in quite the same way as Cube did.
    </p>
<h2>Rendering</h2>
<p>
      The AssaultCube/Cube engine is simplicity itself. The whole map consists of a large 2D array of "cubes", 
      each with a floor and ceiling height, textures (for floor/ceiling/wall) and other properties. 
      These cubes are grouped 2x2 at a time recursively into a "quad tree", which is used hold bigger 
      cubes which can be rendered faster. For those who have edited doom, this is very similar to 
      having a lot of square sectors but at overlapping sizes. This results in a map that can't have 
      room over room (yet), and is pretty cubic, except for the odd slope/slant here and there.
    </p>
<p>
      The floor size of a single unit (single cube) is similar to about 16x16 units in games such as 
      doom &amp; quake, so a staircase step is usually 1 unit, a wall 8 units high etc.
    </p>
<p>
      AssaultCube/Cube renders this world by first determining which cubes are visible using a "dynamic occlusion culling"
      algorithm and frustrum culling. You can see the effect of this when you switch to edit mode (E),
      and then fly out above a map: you'll see parts of the map dropping away as you move. The remaining
      cubes are then rendered in their most efficient size (i.e. cube will render a mixture of 1x1 2x2 4x4
      etc. size cubes, depending on wether they have the same properties: height, texturing etc.).
    </p>
<p>
      If you are on a fast system, or you are playing a simple/small map, AssaultCube/Cube will simply render all
      of these visible cubes (this is indicated by LOD at its maximum of 250 on the hud). AssaultCube/Cube can however
      make complex maps run fast even on slower computers by a technique called LOD: this will render cubes
      that are further away using bigger approximations (2x2 and up), even the properties of the constituent
      cubes don't match exactly. This reduces the amount of polys to be rendered tremendously, and thus allows
      even slow machines to have a consistent frame rate (cube will adapt the LOD figure every frame to aim
      for the fps you specify). The downside is of course, that if the approximations are visible closeup, this
      can lead to ugly graphical glitches (this is called "popup" because it changes as you move). So in the
      end, the choice is up to you: good FPS' or constant visual quality (most engines only cater for the latter).
    </p>
<h2>Networking</h2>
<p>
      You will notice that AssaultCube/Cube plays better on a high ping connection than most games out there. 
      The reason for this is that many things in AssaultCube/Cube are done clientside, not just 
      movement (as is common in games today) but also aim (the fat-client/thin-server model).
    </p>
<p>
      The benefits of this are that the effects of lag are minimised, and someone on a 200 ping can 
      compete on an almost even playing field with someone with a 20 ping, the disadvantages are mainly 
      in that its harder to combat cheating. Recently though, AssaultCube has become <i>slightly</i> more 
      server side to add some cheat prevention into the game, but still does many things client side. 
      Advantages for server administrators are that AssaultCube/Cube servers use virtually no CPU, 
      and very little bandwidth, even with a lot of clients (you can host a 4 player game on a modem!).
    </p>
<p>
      It is impossible to completely hide lag however, and these are some of the effects that can still 
      show lag if you or someone you play with has a high ping / bad connection:
    </p>
<ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the connection has packetloss.
          There is no direct indicator of packetloss, instead the "packet jump" figure is provided on the scoreboard.
          Packet jump says as much as the amount of milliseconds that pass between updates from the indicated player.
          If it is extremely variable, or is high (&gt;80) then your gameplay may be hampered (players jumping from place to place).
          Ideally it is a steady 40 or lower. A consistent packet jump is more vital to gameplay than ping.
        </p>
        <p>
          AssaultCube uses player prediction based on extrapolation using the physics model, 
          in an attempt to be both as up to date as possible with regard to the game state, 
          and as realistic with regard to physics. However, under packet loss this model breaks 
          down and player movement becomes choppy.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If ping is high (either yours or someone you play with), some actions may appear lagged. 
          The effect of ping is generally that the players in a game are effectively playing more 
          and more seperate games, as someone with a high ping is "playing in the past". The local 
          effects of this are masked out by client side movement &amp; aim, but may become noticable across players:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              You may get hit by someone even though you are already out of his view. This is because he is aiming at your movements of a while ago, and his hits take a while to arrive back at you. You may therefore be hit by gunfire up to his lag + your lag milliseconds after you leave his FOV.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Item pickup: you may be denied an item if you try to pick it up at virtually the same time as someone else (the server decides who was "first"). Item pickup is server side, only when you hear the sound effect have you actually picked up the item.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Players dying appears lagged. This will improve.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If a player is severely lagged (or you are) he temporarily becomes a "ghost" that cannot be hit (if &gt;1sec packet jump).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
<h2>Map editing</h2>
<p>
      All map editing is done internally within the game itself. Press E to take you into map-editing mode.
      Internal map editing promotes easy learning of how to edit maps, as well as co-operative 
      map editing. It also makes testing the map (using bots, seeing how it looks like within the games environment, etc.) quite easy. 
      Creating a new map is quite easy, but it takes time to learn the skills needed to create one of fair quality.

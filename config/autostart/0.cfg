// This is an example file that will be automatically executed upon AC startup.
// All .cfg files placed in this config/autostart/ directory will be automatically
// executed when you start AC.

// Files here are executed in alphabetical (or more precise, ASCII) order.
// File names prefixed with "_veryfirst_" will be run before all other scripts.
// Files with names prefixed with "_beforesaved_" or "_aftersaved_" will be
// executed right before or after the file saved.cfg.
// All remaining files will be run right before autoexec.cfg.

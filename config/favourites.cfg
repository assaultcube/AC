// basic favourites category definitions
//
// to add your own, it's best to copy this file to your home directory tree
//  (where saved.cfg is located), and then edit that copy
// another way is to put additional categories into your autoexec.cfg

// every category has the following attributes:
// "weight", "tag", "desc", "red", "green", "blue", "alpha", "keys", "ignore"
// weight: positive weights list a server higher in the list, negative weights list lower
// tag:    short category description, shows in serverbrowser, can use escaped color commands (for example: \f3)
// desc:   detailed category desription
// red, green, blue, alpha: background color for servers of this category, use values from 0..100, use alpha = 0 to disable background color
// keys:   keywords to describe, which servers are in this category
// ignore: 1: disable this category, 0: enable it

// possible key types:
// IP                  IP address of a server, partial addresses can be used
// IP:port             IP & port address of a server
// serverdescription   Description of a server, partial strings are possible
// %mapname            Map name, partial names possible
// #gamemode           Number of a game mode
// >ping               Matches servers with ping above the given number
// $cubescript         Name of an alias to check, if the server should be in the category
// you can prefix a key with '!' to invert it's meaning
// you can prefix a key with '+' to match only populated servers
// if several keys are specified (separated by spaces) every server that matches _any_ of the keys is in the category

// example keys:
// ABC                 matches all servers that have "ABC" as a part of the server description
// 11.22.33.44:28763   matches the server with that IP & port address
// 11.22.33            matches all servers whose IP starts with that string
// %desert             matches all servers with "desert" in the currently played map's name (for example, ac_desert, ac_desert2, ac_desert3, apollo_desertcity)
// %gema               matches all servers with gema maps currently played
// >350                matches all servers with ping > 350
// #5 #13 #14 #15      matches all servers with flag modes currently played
// $offmap             matches all servers with an official map currently played

// cubescript aliases can be used to check more complicated conditions
// the alias gets the server properties as arguments and has to return non-zero, if the server should be in the category
// arg1: mapname, arg2: gamemode number, arg3: ping, arg4: minutesremaining, arg5: number of players, arg6: maxclients, arg7: IP, arg8: port, arg9: pongflags
// pongflags is bit-coded: bit 0: passworded, bit 1: banned, bit 2: blacklisted, bit 6: mastermode

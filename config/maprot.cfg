// Server Side Maprotations...
// WARNING: You can NOT use CubeScript in here!!

// This file specifies a set of rules for the maps to be played on the server. The server automatically uses all available
// maps, so this list only needs to specify general settings and exceptions. It is not necessary, to mention every map here.
// The file is read from top to bottom, so if settings conflict, values from further down overwrite earlier ones (like all
// settings in this file overwrite builtin general defaults). Essentially, every combination of map and mode has a set of
// values for all keywords.

// per line: map_name list_of_modes keyword:value [keyword:value] [keyword:value] ...

// map_name:
//  - a corresponding map file needs to be in packages/maps/official, packages/maps/servermaps or packages/maps/servermaps/incoming
//  - the file ending "cgz" will be added automatically
//  - map name can end with an asterisk to match multiple maps, as single "*" will match all maps
//  - map names can only contain: lowercase chars, digits, '_', '-' and '.'

// list_of_modes: (no spaces)
//  - can contain any number and combination of these: ctf|dm|htf|ktf|lss|osok|pf|surv|tdm|tktf|tlss|tosok|tpf|tsurv

// keywords: (no spaces between keyword and value allowed)
//  - weight: values range from -100 to +100 and influence how often a map+mode will be played (higher number: more often)
//  - repeat: values range from -100 to +100 and influence how fast a map+mode can be played again (higher number: sooner)
//  - time: default game time in minutes
//  - mintime: minimum voteable game time in minutes
//  - maxtime: maximum voteable game time in minutes
//  - minplayers: minimum number of players for the map+mode to be suggested
//  - maxplayers: maximum number of players for the map+mode to be suggested
//  - maxteamsize: maximum number of active players per team (total for ffa modes)
//  - teamthreshold: number of players that mark the threshold between "better play team" and "better play ffa"
//  - manual: 1:map+mode will not be suggested by the server (users need to vote for this map+mode themselves)
//  - restrict: 0:player, 1:master, 2:admin, 3:owner 9:elvis (default is 0)
// (weight and repeat values can accumulate within their boundaries)

// default settings for all maps:
* ctf|dm|htf|ktf|lss|osok|pf|surv|tdm|tktf|tlss|tosok|tpf|tsurv mintime:4 maxtime:20 teamthreshold:4 // all modes
* ctf|htf|tdm|tktf|tlss|tosok|tpf|tsurv time:15 maxteamsize:6  minplayers:4 // team modes
* dm|ktf|lss|osok|pf|surv               time:10 maxteamsize:10 maxplayers:7 // ffa modes

// default tweaks
* lss|osok|surv|tlss|tosok|tsurv weight:-10 // be careful with suggesting arena modes automatically
* pf|surv|tlss|tpf|tsurv manual:1 // players need to really want these
* ctf weight:10 // some players like this mode

// map-specific setting for official maps: (some examples)
//ac_douze ctf manual:1 restrict:9 // disable ctf douze, if it were a possible game mode
//ac_iceroad ctf|dm|htf|ktf|lss|osok|pf|surv|tdm|tktf|tlss|tosok|tpf|tsurv manual:1 restrict:9 // completely disable ac_iceroad
//ac_shine ctf repeat:-50 // not too often

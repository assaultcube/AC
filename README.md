## What is AssaultCube?
AssaultCube is a **FREE**, multiplayer, first-person shooter game, based on the
[CUBE engine](http://cubeengine.com/cube.php).

Taking place in realistic environments, with fast, arcade gameplay,
it's addictive and fun!

With efficient bandwidth usage, it's low-latency and can even run over a 56 Kbps
connection. It's tiny too, weighing in at a lightweight about 50 MB package
available for [Windows, Linux, Mac](https://assault.cubers.net/download.html).
On the correct settings, it can even run on old hardware (Pentium III and above).

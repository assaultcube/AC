// executed when you start AC.

// Files here are executed in alphabetical order, the order of priority is:
// 0-9, a-z, A-Z, and symbols. Therefore the file 0.cfg, if it exists,
// will always be executed before this file.

// NOTE: The /config/autoexec.cfg can still be used to override anything!

// Note: $showmenuonstartup is intended to be controlled by the setting in the Misc settings menu.
// It is not recommended to manually edit the value of this alias.

Add things that have changed ON THE SVN TRUNK since 1.0 in here, so that when release time comes around, 
it is much easier to record what has changed since it's already recorded here. 

Things not to add: 	Bugs made during SVN development that were fixed (Since these bugs were not a problem
			in the last release).

			Documentation changes --> Releases are expected to always have new documentation.

- SLEEPY: only allow v121 and later
- win98 gf2 video init crash?
- better fist?
- chmod solution? -> release as tar.gz
- check with vtune for cpu bottlenecks on ksp1
- put in scaling hack for sloppy ATI drivers
- integrate new dcp pistol model/start weapon 
- monsters & jumppads
- hide monsters until triggered?
- trigger when monsters die?
- but back the idea of a overwritable config.cfg so settings are easier to change in game?
- improve particle engine / make all weapons have more satisfying effects / better sounds overal / lighting on rocket explosion
- demos play even from old protocol versions / scoreboards sometimes stick
- weapon keeps shooting if you switch to edit/talk while shooting / hide hud weapon in edit mode
- load demo when already playing a demo: see yourself
- load demo of map editing -> crash?
- larger ideas to revamp cube editing/rendering:
  * can cube internal representation be replaced with typeless representation?
    2x floorceil, 8xvert offset, and 2x wall offset? (can we do it without floorceil even? byterange?)
  * new lighting (diff floor ceiling like doom64?) can use lightmap the size of the world
    to save on polys and make lighting more precise?
    -> also other ways to reduce on polys by splitting
    -> can merge polys better
    most important however would be to allow walls to have different light than floor/ceil depending on light angle
    and better/sharper shadows
  * change texture list to be textures used rather than slots to allow >256
  * proper way of doing multilevel?
  * a way of rendering that makes static vertex arrays and culling coexist? larger chunks?
    -> speed is hardly the problem anymore with current cube maps, though may be nice once higher detail geometry editing methods are in
  * remove LOD completely
  * ways to reduce sparklies?
    - render water only where needed... or with some sort of zbuffer trick?
  * faster cube occlusion culling by checking distance from each cube rather than raytracing... do so using quad tree and in direction of viewer
- gluPerspective wrong fov?
- fake opengl light for models? (not for bridges)
- do something about people having wrong maps etc / map cheating / make auto map download
- super simple CTF using pickup - drop off idea pxtl ? no team spawns required!
- allow monster spawn on trigger?
- VWEP (slith has own weapons), muzzle flash? 
- About 2 out of 3 times I start Cube (Linux Version), the fps counter displays -214748 
- make water render not everywhere to reduce sparklies
- vertex/fragment programs
  global: millis, eye, eyeorient
  vertex: normal, Svec?, Tvec? closest light / light dir vec ?
  opengl: matrices etc.
  or instead simple regcombine setup?
  - shaders stuff
    - allow texture rotation
    - glow
- under some circumstances, players can not be hurt in multiplayer (wrong lifetime???)
  (after any spawn, also in ffa, lasts until disconnect)
- out of memory bug (just on or after new player join).
- mapmodels above eachother gives incorrect physics
- fps reporting on demos.../ teleport to spawn?
- improve sounds
#1 Ability to get attributes of a single cube at $xsel, $ysel. 
#3 Ability to get the current users position (or cursor position, X,Y & height)
#5 Provide Absolute mode in at least functions edittex,editheight,vdelta.

check:
- no text when dead? / round over while dead? -> more lag than appearent
- can't spawn when 1 is lagging
- sendmap hang?
- specator mode for arena also
- avoid spawn next to eachother : most difficult in arena because spawns all at same time, meaning you can't check other people's position
- show last persons health?
- bigger monsters can get stuck on top of mapmodels
- disable hudgun when dead
- make disconnection faster (now can last up to 60 secs)... what features depend on this?


TODO:
=====
recent stuff:
- try and debug depth read? GL_DEPTH_SCALE/GL_DEPTH_BIAS
- detect if sw driver? glXIsDirect(dpy, ctx) (can't get context from SDL) / glGetString(GL_VENDOR/RENDERER) (many HW drivers use mesa as base)
- make server port configurable?
- not reproducable: When you pop out of edit mode where a bridge is right under a ceiling you get stuck.
- Also, when you stay over a vertical jumppad it pushes you up by decreasing amounts and then after a few rounds of that it pushes you really high. That's not necessarily bad, but it is weird. 
- jumppads don't work for monsters
- try to go FMOD-only?
- new weapon models?
- profiling / replace gluBuild2DMipmaps, its too slow
- maxplayers?
- protocol: send map checksums so checking can happen?

rendering:
- integrate fisheye mod?
- fix large overdraw on fog culling?
- particles look v bad in fog/water
- allow up to fov 135 or so (need to tweak various frustrum culling optis)
- experiment with alpha textures & shiny textures for second unit... -> generate normals only for surfs that use it
- try out VAR without copying? -> almost no speedup, too cpu bound
- use VAR on chunks of the world
- speed up md2 render -> put into array too... maybe can render multiple walking monsters from same array? (since same time moment)
- texture precache?
- try out also up/down occlusion culling?
- fix corner textures, and make all 4 walls L-R
- render sky polys more efficiently? can't be done with light. need to collect "sky space" and render seperately
- reassign mip 1 quads / mip n quads for big open maps
- skybox roll not working yet
- cull explosions/particles etc outside frustrum
- stripify walls?
- instead of having defer 0 or 1, have a range that rates its visible disruptiveness

world structure / editing:
- make mip opti tags compliant?
- generic push/pull for vdeltas
- how to allow editing features as trigger scripts (since they reset triggers/monsters).
  other triggers... certainly a NULL trigger that affects no tags
  floor/ceil height, texture change, solid,
  spawn stuff?
  waterlevel raise/lower
  could select tag areas and then do edit callback.. problem is how to generically restore them
- need more commands that influence the world in a gameplay way for trigger scripts
- ror by models?
- hom in custom arch?
- vdelta mipping often wrong
- improve selecting in void and selecting heightmaps / selecting areas with much height variation
- "platform" extra floors or something similarly simple?
- generate terrain as edit command (also for 2x2 and 4x4 mips!)
- arbitrary shapes a la archvertex
- flip/rotate commands
- off-vertex feature?
- coop copy & paste / other ops
- make showmip show acurate values (use real light values)
- make mapopt atleast also do 4x4
- intermission cam entity?
- make "corner" equalize height automatically?
- "are you sure" when edits have been made
- wr: render too high wall if z is mip mapped (1 unit indent)
- wr: walls behind corners
- wr: SEMISOLID still causes faces in the floor -> extend issemi
- hom: normal walls next to huge mips (on DM2?)
- hom: a 2x2 solid next to only a partial HF [workaround: cut up wall]
- hom: a 2x2 solid next to concave 2x2 hf    [workaround: cut up wall]
- hom: cap on a equal height floor/ceil      [workaround: make height diff]
- allow 2 or more levels?
- multiple selections
- each client in editmode should be able to see the selection outline of other clients that are in editmode.
- expand random map gen ?
- texture language: each texture number becomes a little program for
  texturing. [ warning: must be in both worldrender & mipmapping code
  for correct results. ] possibilities:
  * all the shader tricks
  * random textures: select any from a set
  * checkerboard tile 2 textures
  * auto border tiling (when texture touches same height/texture
    or not): textures specified (any amount):
    1. texture center
    2. texture border (replaces 1 when touching changing blocks)
    3. texture corner (replaces 2 on 2 touching)
    4. inner corner (replaces 2/3 when indented corner)
    will work on both floors and walls, and will make nice
    texturing with rims _extremely_ easy.

script / console:
- make editing-only binds?
- delay "music" and "loadsky" commands, such that they do not load multiple times.
- make onrelease work everywhere?
- beep on "say"
- save config.cfg / move autoexec.cfg to last?
- international keyboards?

multiplayer:
- insta arena
- accumulate accuracy / efficiency / rails in a row / frags in a row stats
- arena numplayers>1 & other recent addons / rename "arena" to "last man standing"
- allow servers to set port
- render CS_LAGGED differently?
- spectator mode
- make everyone spec for duel/team modes
- admin feature
- mode 2 duel?
- frags should be in c2s welcome packet
- simplify tp: only red/blue, otherwise spectate
- add time spend on server to scoreboard
- specify distance in some way for network ? distance / occlusion / standing still / dead
- compress some things about network stream?
- all physics pushes don't affect players across the network
- servers should send map checksums, small differences in map entities pos could potentially cause crashes, same for out of range ents on clients.
- implement http get for masterserver?
- vote: either explain it or make it easier.. generally make a multiplayer connect walkthru
- rethink map get? make it even easier???
- locking of in-progress games
- when switching to map that player doesnt have... something better should happen than keep them in old map with floating players
- capture the chicken mode? other different DM modes? domination? holy wars?
- teamplay scores don't record frags of disconnected players
- teamplay binds
- ctf mode
- character selection... maybe also sounds... relatively easy, maybe share monster/player stuff more
- when failed to connect, not clear not connected on map reload?
- time remaining not clearly printed...
- interpolated demo playback?
- dont allow duplicate player names
- make carrots work correctly in mp, and various other things in mp
- maybe also make deaths instant
- console scores
- can jump thru players easily when both move.. make sure offset to correct side?
- add network interpolation as an option?
- different pain sounds for levels of damage applied, or level of health?

SP/monsters
- less <10h -> scared
- monster weapons go thru mapmodels.
- lava/water hurt
- think about save game / copy stats for sp
- think about introducing rpg style elements: weapon/stat upgrades, inventory items
- wake up others nearby?
- secrets
- barrels
- gibs for health?
- other interesting monster behaviour... pacifist until first shot?
- make monsters flee
- spawn sound?
- maybe make 2 versions of each monster to make up for the lack of them (different skins?)
- player/monster on top of eachother
- coop (not easy, requires lots of sync & bw management).
- use tracing code also for player1? too many problems with it...
- new trigger types... floor raise/lower, secrets

gameplay:
- sky hurt
- splash sound frequently when looking straight up from water
- increase amount of blood / better particle lifetimes
- think of how make kills etc more satisfying
- dynblight when player shoots
- make some of the gameplay code in script? problem, for multiplayer this will make cheating easy.
- overhead map: show open & closed doors
- fun: racing game easter egg
- use Mix_SetPosition() for positional sound
- anim frames for death
- <metlslime> - fix the shotgun behavior :)
- auto weapon change?
- traceline related:
  * replace readpixels since its very problematic?
  -> must solve by software, can't disable depth buffer for models
  * RL stops behind chasing player
  * RL path must be cut short on direct hit
  * guns shots go thru players, and they can miss if model sticks in front
    of bounding box

physics
- optimise stair physics for 2x1 slopes -> interferes with stairs
- speed up monster-monster and monster-mapmodel collision
- for 1 cube wide obstackles, push player past it
- give player velocity coming out of teleport -> direction he's facing
- improve slant sliding
- improve heightfield physics?

light stuffs:
- blend out dynlight longer?
- sun lighting?
- player shadows?
- quad damage player dynlight?
- switchable lights? lights that oscillate in strength?

changes for bigger landscapes:
- hf: hom next to big mips / water height
- make correct collision for slopes
- push/pull vertex tools
- different scale: *2 in xy, and /2 in z, ratio is then 1:4 (so float hf can be removed) 
- more tree/plant map models
- optimize certain code for 2k^2 maps.. lighting?
- cut&paste entities also?
- limit occlusion distance?

non-code:
- improve default keybinds for editing -> docs / find better keys for modifiers?
- email all model authors
- check all dm spawns big enough for monsters
- sounds! monster see
- more sp maps?
- better tree skin / more models?
- add metl3?
- dgtex?
- q3 tree mapmodels?
